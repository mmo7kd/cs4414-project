Using the google maps android V2 API and the google directions API,
this android app gives a human-readable walking direction service around the grounds of the University of Virginia.
To get directions between any two points, simply tap the start and end points on the map screen. The app is still
in its infancy, but this prototype shows vast potential for the service's future!
